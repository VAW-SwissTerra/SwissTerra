# terra â€” SwissTerra archival image processing

## Installation
Installation through conda is currently the only supported method.

```bash
# This will create an environment called swissterra and download all the packages
conda env create --file environment.yml
```
then
```bash
python setup.py 
```
OR
```bash
python setup.py develop --user
```
to allow modification of the source code in place.

Also make sure to set up the `agisoft_LICENSE` environment variable to point to `metashape.lic` in the Metashape installation folder.

### Data
The data should either be in a folder/symlink called `input/` in the working directory, or be defined by the environment variable `SWISSTERRA_INPUT_DIR` (which takes precedence).

Run `terra data check` to validate that all files can be located.

## Usage
Run `terra` to see the how to run the program.
